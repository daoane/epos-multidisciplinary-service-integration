# EPOS_service_integration
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with documentation for demonstrating multidisciplinary interaction with diverse EPOS data services, data integration and simple visualisation. The notebook uses data from TCS Geological Information and Modelling, GNSS data, and Seismology, and some data that is loaded from other sources. To get started, follow the steps explained in the HTML-documentation. The only file that you need to copy to your working directory is the notebook.
